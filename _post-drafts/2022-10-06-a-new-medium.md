# "Media for Thinking the Unthinkable" - 10 Years Later

On April 4, 2023, it will have been 10 years since Bret Victor gave his talk, "Media for Thinking
the Unthinkable." Where are we on this vision?

The talk has the following outline:

1. Introduction
2. Seeing behavior
3. Seeing the entire behavior
4. Thinking the unthinkable
5. Multiple representations of behavior
6. Interacting with behavior
7. Linked representations
8. Creating representations
9. Closing


The key questions as I see it are thus:
- How useful is it to see the behavior of a system?
- How useful is it to see the *entire* behavior?
- Are there unthinkable thoughts? And is it a new representation that allows us to think them or is
  it the *act* of such a representation that allows us to think them?
- To what extent are dynamic representations useful? When are they useful?
- How do we create representations?
- What are the tasks we even hope to facilitate with such representations?

Unthinkable thoughts are slightly different. If we accept Turing completeness, then surely all
thoughts are thinkable (unlike our other senses). The differences is the *degree* to which they are
thinkable, given our the finite resources of our minds & tools. For example, pen and paper extends
our memory, letting us think more complicated thoughts by writing them down. But now we are really
at the Turing model (see Ed Hutchins book). Indeed it's more a question of *how hard* it is to think
a thought. Even banning words doesn't work, just makes some things a bit harder to say.

See also, expressiveness of programming languages for a riff on this idea.

That's not to say that the ease is unimportant. No, in fact how easy it is to think things is
*absolutely* important! But what it does suggest is that the adjacent possible is always there. The
things that will be automated tomorrow are the things we do manually today. The current wave of AI
is congruent with this, simply speeding up or automating tasks we already do. Hell, the iPhone is
the same way (although it's also a physical object).

It is through a series of such "speed ups" that we actually witness transformative changes. Texting
is a faster form of communication that also doesn't require moving, though other forms of remote
communication existed before then too. Even smoke signals were a thing long ago.

Being able to do things 10x faster *is* transformative. So it's not that some thoughts are
*unthinkable*, it's more that some thoughts take *longer* to think than others. And the landscape of
thought speeds may be quite complex. Certain kinds of copying in code took a long time, and are now
easy with Copilot.

So if we take this approach, then the logical next step for creating a new medium is to first
*automate what has already been done*. Pen and paper work really well, yet we *still* struggle to
reproduce common structures on computers. Again, it's not that we *can't* it's that it takes a long
time, so fewer people have access to it given their limited resources.



Ideas exist on a spectrum of formality. Our tools and representations should reflect this.
