Winter 2017 was the first of many quarters where I synthesized themes I found in the different courses I was taking. This quarter I took Programming Languages, where I learned the programming languages SML, Ruby, and Racket; Hardware/Software Interface, where I learned the programming language C; and the Honors class Ways of Meaning, where I studied cultural differences through language.

I learned that ideas I thought were universal, like “friend” and “love,” are actually very culturally specific. Ways of Meaning introduced me to a culturally agnostic method for defining and comparing words in different languages called the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), pioneered by Anna Wierzbicka. Wierzbicka posits that complex, culturally specific words can be defined as combinations of primitive, culturally independent words like “good,” “someone,” and “the same.” I also learned about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which suggests that language influences thought.

Consider two languages: blue and red. Describing red words with blue words is difficult, even if there is a blue word that’s almost like a red word, you need to find other blue words that express the differences. “It’s like x but with y and without z.” Even then the best you can do is probably roughly approximate the meaning of the red word. In contrast, NSM identifies the language-agnostic building blocks of words in both languages, making comparison easier.


This works even for words within a language. For example, think about how you might describe the difference between terrified and horrified. Here are the definitions Wierzbicka gives in “The Semantics of Emotions: Fear and Its Relatives in English”

**Terrified**
- X feels something
- sometimes a person thinks something like this:
  - something very bad is happening
  - because of this, something very bad can happen to me now
  - I don’t want this
  - because of this I would want to do something
  - I can’t do anything
- because of this, this person feels something very bad
- X feels like this

**Horrified**
- X feels something
- sometimes a person thinks something like this:
  - something very bad is happening to someone
  - I didn’t think that something like this could happen
  - I don’t want this
  - because of this I would want to do something
  - one can’t do anything
- because of this, this person feels something bad
- X feels like this

These definitions are simple and understandable. Their structures are easy to compare, and highlight
the subtle differences in each definition.


Since a big theme of Programming Languages was to compare different languages and how they affect the way people write programs, I tried to use NSM and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis to think more deeply about my CS classes. This culminated in my favorite essay I wrote Ways of Meaning:
