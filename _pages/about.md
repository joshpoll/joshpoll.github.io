Hi! I'm Josh Pollock, a third year PhD student at MIT. I work on domain-specific languages for
visualization in the VIS group with Arvind Satyanarayan.

My current interest is in helping people create and reason about all kinds of visualizations, not
just the ones data visualization most commonly studies like bar charts and scatterplots, but also
the ones we don't, like chemical reactions, concept maps, and neural network architecture diagrams.
We read these [graphic
representations](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=c136c6f0-b987-4264-aeef-db053ea56a61) the
same way we read charts:

- using [elementary perceptual
tasks](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288400#metadata_info_tab_contents) identified by Cleveland &
McGill

- using [perceptual grouping principles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3482144/)
identified by Gestalt psychologists

Together these form, respectively, the elementary and compositional mappings from data to visual elements. By
sprinkling in a little PL magic, we can leverage this structure to build software tools that empower
more people to make more graphic representations. And these graphic representations can dramatically
improve our ability to think and communicate ideas.

Prior to my work at MIT, I spent four years at the University of Washington earning my B.S. in
Computer Science and working in the [PLSE group](https://uwplse.org/) with Zachary Tatlock, Jared
Roesch, and Eunice Jun. This was an incredibly collaborative research environment where I learned a
ton by being a fly on the wall during lots of research discussions, lunch talks, and seminars. It
was also where I was introduced to
[PL+X](http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2015/05/27/what-is-pl-research-and-how-is-it-useful/), the idea
of applying PL techniques to areas outside of core PL.

Outside of work I enjoy dancing (currently salsa, in the past house and hip hop), playing bass
guitar, and gardening.
